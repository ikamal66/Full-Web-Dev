Attributes:
lang="en" here,lang is an attribute

-- <a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>  // It is called anchor tag
Here, href is an attribute that tells the browser where the link should go.

We can use of inLine css in HTML: 
<p style="background-color: salmon;"></p>
Here, style is an style attribute

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    here, rel and href is an attribute

anchor tag: 
The <a> tag (anchor tag) in HTML is used to create hyperlinks. It allows users to navigate to another webpage, a section of the same page, an email, or even a downloadable file
-> eske andar hum link daalte hai open karne ke liye

 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com">Open Google</a>
 here, we use of target="_blank" because we want to open google.com site in the new tab

If over link add in horizontal way, we want in verital or next line than we use of paragraph tag, it is a dirty approach
we don't use of paragraph tag for the making the list
