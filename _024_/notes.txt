Text Shadows:

It can elevate the readability of the text or give it an elegant appearance.
text-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur color;

.text-element { text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #888888; }

Outlines:
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out"
outline: width style color;
.button-element:focus { outline: 2px solid blue; }

Differences between Outlines and Borders:
Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.
Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.
Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot.

    outline-offset: 27px; --
    This property can be helpful when you want to create a visual separation between an element's outline and its border.
