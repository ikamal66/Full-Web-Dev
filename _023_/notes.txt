display: inline; -- convert block element to inline element
if we using of display: inline --> then the margin and padding will not be changed from the top and width also not work

so, we have to use of -
display: inline-block;

 display: none; --  don't show anything

.box1{
    /* display: none; */
    visibility: hidden;
}
by using of display: none --> it will remove the object as well as the space
when we use of visibility: hidden --> it will remove only the object not the space
