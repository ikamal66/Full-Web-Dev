To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000

Importance:
The !important flag in CSS is used to give a particular style rule the highest level of importance, overriding any other competing styles
!important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points.
