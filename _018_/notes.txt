CSS Box Model:
box-sizing: border-box; -->
It is border + padding size, it will not include the margin

Margin collapse:
When two elements are stacked vertically and both have margins, the margins between them can "collapse" into a single margin that's equal to the greater of the two individual margins.
Instead of adding their margins together, only the larger margin is applied.
Here's a simple example:
Element A has a bottom margin of 20px.
Element B has a top margin of 10px.
If these elements are directly adjacent to each other, the resulting margin between them will be 20px, not 30px. This phenomenon is known as "margin collapse."
