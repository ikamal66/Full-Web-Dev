// Image tag:
<img height="230" src="train image.jpg"  alt="train image" >

height="230" here, width automatically adjust according to the image ratio
we have to use of only one attribute such as height or width 
we don't write px in the end because they are already in px

// Table Tag:
we first of all use of table tag <table> </table>
<td> --> it is called table data
<th> --> it is called table heading
<tr> --> it is called table row

<td colspan="2"> --> uses to give the gap b/w the columns

//Before using of colspan
