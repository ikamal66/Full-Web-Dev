Universal Selector:
    represented by "*" targets all the HTML elements on the page.

Element Selector (Type Selector)
    The element selector selects the target element based on the specific type.
    Suppose you want to underline all the <p> tags; in this case, the element selector will be the best choice.

ID Selector
    The ID selector targets the elements based on the specific ID.
    It is written with the hash “#” character followed by the ID name in the style sheet.

Class Selector
    The class selector does the same job as the id selector, a class selector helps group various types of elements.
    Suppose, we want to give a custom style to a specific group of elements. In this case, the class selector is the best option.
    It is written with the period “.” character followed by the class name in the style sheet.
