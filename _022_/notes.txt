hmare pass bahut saari unit hoti hai CSS ke andar-

margin: auto;
The margin: auto property in CSS centers a block element horizontally within its parent container. 
It automatically calculates and evenly distributes the remaining space around the element.
Work only on the block element not on the inline element.

 margin: 23px auto; -- here, 23px is the bottom-up space and auto is the left-right space.

 width: 80vw; -- vw(viewport's width)  -- use when we want to give width
 height: 20vh;-- vh(viewport's height)  -- use when we want to give height

 font-size: 20px;
 font-size: 2em; --we provide here 20px by using of 2em it will double the font size i.e 40px
 if you set an element's font-size to 2em, it will be twice the size of its parent element's font size.

 font-size: 2rem;
 If the root element's font size is 16px, then 2rem will make the font size 32px, effectively doubling it

 width: 100vmin; -- 100 vmin means 100vh in my laptop
 width: 100vh;  -- it is also same as above

 vmin means -- minimum kya hai apne device ke andar, laptop ke andar minimum height hoti hai mobile ke andar minimum width hoti hai
 so vmin in laptop is height and vmin in mobile is width

 width: 50%; -- it will adjust the width according to the parent element
